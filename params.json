  "body": "# Azure Copy\r\n\r\n\r\nAllows easy copying between S3, Azure, Dropbox, Sharepoint Online, OneDrive and local filesystem. \r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nTo access each cloud provider various keys/passwords will needed to be added to the azurecopy.exe.config (or app.config if you're coding your own). The AppSetting keys to use are:\r\n\r\nAzure:\r\n<add key=\"AzureAccountKey\" value=\"\" />\r\n\r\nS3:\r\n<add key=\"AWSAccessKeyID\" value=\"\" />\r\n<add key=\"AWSSecretAccessKeyID\" value=\"\" />\r\n<add key=\"AWSRegion\" value=\"us-west-2\" />\r\n\r\nOneDrive: (yes yes, it still says skydrive in the config).\r\n<add key=\"SkyDriveCode\" value=\"\" />\r\n<add key=\"SkyDriveRefreshToken\" value=\"\" />\r\n\r\nDropbox:\r\n<add key=\"DropBoxAPIKey\" value=\"\" />\r\n<add key=\"DropBoxAPISecret\" value=\"\" />\r\n\r\nSharepoint Online:\r\n<add key=\"SharepointUsername\" value=\"\" />\r\n<add key=\"SharepointPassword\" value=\"\" />\r\n\r\nFor Azure,S3 and Sharepoint Online you simply copy the configuration values from the appropriate portal to the azurecopy.exe.config file directly. If you are unsure where to find these configuration values\r\nplease feel free to contact me at ken.faulkner@gmail.com and I can direct you.\r\n\r\nFor OneDrive and Dropbox the configuration is a little more invovled.\r\n\r\nFor OneDrive you need to issue the command:\r\n\r\nazurecopy -configonedrive\r\n\r\nand then follow the instructions. This basically involves copying a URL to a browser, accepting the OneDrive prompt saying you allow AzureCopy to access your OneDrive account and then copying part of the response \r\nURL back into the command prompt. The instructions will be clearly displayed in the command prompt.\r\n\r\nFor Dropbox you need to issue the command:\r\n\r\nazurecopy -configdropbox \r\n\r\nAgain, follow the instructions and the config file will be automatically modified for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Examples:\r\n\r\n\r\nS3 to Azure using regular copy:   azurecopy.exe -i https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/myblob -o https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer\r\nS3 to Azure using blob copy api (better for local bandwidth: azurecopy.exe -i https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/myblob -o https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer -blobcopy\r\nAzure to S3: azurecopy.exe -i https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob -o https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/ \r\nList contents in S3 bucket: azurecopy.exe -list https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/\r\nList contents in Azure container: azurecopy.exe -list https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/ \r\nOnedrive to local using regular copy: azurecopy.exe -i sky://temp/myfile.txt -o c:\\\\temp\\\\\");\r\nDropbox to local using regular copy: azurecopy.exe -i https://dropbox.com/temp/myfile.txt -o c:\\\\temp\\\\\r\n\r\nMore examples will be added directly to AzureCopy which you can see by running the command:\r\n\r\nazurecopy -examples\r\n\r\n",
